This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
x=2
y=3
x+y
```

```{r test}
hist(rnorm(10000), col ="tomato")
```

```{r}
x
```

We determined that the sum 1 and 2 was `r 1+2` surprisingly

```{r}
dragons <- read.csv("/Users/lanqi/Desktop/dragons.csv")
hist(dragons$wingspan)
```
```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(dragons[1:5,])
kable(summary(dragons))
```
```{r}
mice <- read.csv("mouse_report.csv")
kable(mice[1:20,c(2,4,5)])
```
```{r}
kable(summary(mice))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
